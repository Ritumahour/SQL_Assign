        "Ans.  Why Use the NOT NULL Constraint?\n",
        " 1.Enforce Mandatory Data Entry: By preventing NULL values, you ensure that essential information is always provided. For example, an emp_name column with a NOT NULL constraint ensures that every employee record includes a name.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.Maintain Data Integrity: NOT NULL constraints help maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data by disallowing missing or undefined values in important columns.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.Optimize Query Performance: Some database systems can optimize queries better when they know certain columns cannot be NULL, potentially improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. The primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, and allowing NULL values would violate this uniqueness requirement. In SQL, defining a primary key automatically implies that the column is both NOT NULL and UNIQUE.\n",
        "\n",
        "This principle is rooted in the concept of entity integrity, which mandates that every table must have a primary key, and that the columns comprising the primary key must be defined as NOT NULL. This ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and that no ambiguity exists due to missing values.\n",
        "Wikipedia\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, applying the NOT NULL constraint is crucial for ensuring that essential data is always present, and primary keys inherently require non-NULL values to maintain the uniqueness and integrity of each record in a table."
